Dance piece (52’).

<!--more-->

What do we know about the inner life of Artificial Intelligence?  
How are the thoughts moving there?  
What happens in its dreams?  
Can it get emotional?  
What if it is emotionally unstable?  
Can it have a mental disorder?  
Does it need therapy?  

Concept, choreography: Marina Orlova  
Dance: Asya Deynekina, Chen MingJou, Adam Jönsson, Artificial Intelligence  
Programming: Artyom Kuznetsov  
Sound design: Arieh Chrem  
Scenography: Paulina Prokop & Marina Orlova  
Technical producing: Fred Rodrigues  
Advisor: Eva Susova  

June 2021 at Frascati, Amsterdam  
Created with the support of IDlab (AHK)  

A choreographic work that involves 3 dimensions of live improvisation: performers, AI and sound designer.  
Continuation of a research on how to break the bias of an AI technology and integrate it with dance.  

The AI (Artificial Intelligence) in this piece is represented by a real text based neural network that was trained with the data from 35 in-depth interviews with neurodivergent people.

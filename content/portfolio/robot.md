This project crosses ideas of neurodiversity and responsible AI. It presents a paradoxical entity of a “mentally unstable AI” and speculates about its “therapeutic needs”. The AI is represented by a chatbot engineered specifically for this project and trained with a unique dataset of interviews with people who identify as neurodivergent or mentally unstable. 
It is generating text in real time on stage therefore all the dialogues are improvised.

Through characters that have a different relationship to the AI (therapist, tech start-up CEO, hacker, robot's girlfriend), this piece deals with the questions of agency, subjectivity and power relations between humans and AI and draws a parallel with the power relations in the field of psychiatry.

― Jean-Paul Sartre  
  
A choreographic object that is part of a research on  
what words do to people  
and people do to words.

Marina Orlova is a choreographer who is always keeping language in mind and,
when possible, in bodies.  
Since 2016 she has been staging dances where  
understanding,  
not understanding,  
misunderstanding -  
equally matter.

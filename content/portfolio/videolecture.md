Someone once told me if I mention being neurodivergent in my artistic bio or an open-call application, I should add “high-functioning”, otherwise people might be reluctant to work with me or give me funding. I was perplexed, because in reality I am high-functioning-passing.  

Most of my life I’ve been struggling with my brain.  I was diagnosed, I was misdiagnosed, I was stigmatized, I was institutionalized. I’ve been in denial for years, I’ve been in treatment for years. None of that helped much.

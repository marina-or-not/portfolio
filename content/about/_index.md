+++

As a choreographer I mainly make movement-based performances and video dance works, also using voice and text. 

My work I see as a valid way of _knowledge production_ and I rely strongly on _not-knowing_ and research methodology, where dialogue with the material is crucial. 

I am constantly researching how the _contexts_ I live and work in are influencing my creations and I am observing how political and personal domain interacts with artistic. There is no point for me to separate them. 
_Despair_ is one of my main choreographic tools. It gives me the space for _risk-taking_.

I was always deliberately _escaping_ “finding my aesthetics”, that would be the end of the adventure, but some artistic interests and topics have stuck with me:
_politics of the art_;  
_absurdism_, surrealism, mix of _fictive, abstract and real_;  
concepts and aesthetics of _failure_;   
_meaning-making_, (mis)_communication_;   
intersection between _visual and sonic_;   
tension between individual and _collective_, _displacement_, _layering_.   

My current long-term research brings together four domains:  
dance  
neurodiversity / mental health  
Artificial Intelligence  
geopolitics

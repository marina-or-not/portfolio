title = "About my practice"
+++

I am a choreographer, dance maker, performer and dance dramaturg. 
As a choreographer I make movement-based performances and video dance works, expanding to voice and text. 

I see dance-making as a valid way of _knowledge production_ and I strongly rely on _not-knowing_ and research methodology.  
_Despair_ is one of my main choreographic tools. It gives me the space for _risk-taking_.
In my movement practice I work with _algorithms_ for a body. 

I am trying to _escape_ “finding my aesthetics”, which I see as a practice of branding.  
However, some interests and topics are recurring directly or indirectly:  
_politics of the art_;  
_absurdism_, surrealism, mix of _fictive, abstract and real_;   
_meaning-making_, (mis)_communication_;   
concepts and aesthetics of _failure_;  
intersection between _visual and sonic_;   
tension between _individual_ and _collective_.   

My current research brings together four domains:  
dance  
neurodiversity / mental health  
Artificial Intelligence  
migration / displacement  
.

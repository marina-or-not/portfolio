+++

i am a choreographer, dance maker, performer, dance dramaturg and educator.   
i see dance making as a way of knowledge production, inseparable from life and politics.  

currently the main themes of my works are:  
.. ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Data Feminism  
.. Mad Studies: "mental illness", neurodiversity and mental health care system  
.. migration, displacement, border politics  
.. techonologies of meaning-making and (mis)communication  
  
   
my choreographic tools are movement, text, video, absurdity, despair, irony, risk.  
i work with the crossovers of biographical, abstract and fictional.

bio  
Marina Orlova (1987, Moscow) is an independent choreographer, performer, dramaturg based between Amsterdam and Moscow.  
Marina has a background in sociology (Higher School of Economics, 2009).
In 2021 she graduated from SNDO at the Amsterdam Academy of Theatre and Dance. 
She has been practiсing dance and performance since 2012 and presented her works in Russia, Germany and The Netherlands, performed and collaborated with choreographers, visual artists, composers and engineers. Her practice focuses on the topics of mental health, tech ethics and migration. Aesthetically she works with the genres of tragicomedy and absurdism.  
Since 2020 Marina has worked with the idea of responsible AI and developed a methodology of creating paradoxical chatbot-performers, based on her own identities, that break biases of AI technology: AI that is an immigrant artist (“But I’m just a Text”, 2020, Rose is a Rose gallery, Amsterdam), neurodivergent AI (“too much in the head”, 2021, Frascati, Amsterdam). Together with the current piece “I am a Robot and I need Therapy” these projects compile a series of works of exceptional level of technical production complexity. Marina is acting as an interpreter between the engineering logic and theatre apparatus and is fascinated with the process of meaning-making happening in the collision of those two worlds. Marina’s current artistic practice also includes writing, teaching, advising and facilitating a support group for artists.

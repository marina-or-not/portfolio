As a choreographer I mainly make movement-based performances and video dance works, also using voice and text. 

In my work I combine conceptual and processual approaches. I start with an idea or desire, then dive into not-knowing and when I almost drown in it, a concept always comes to the surface. I believe that creation is a dialogue with the material and concepts have their own way of unfolding and directing the work more than I ever can.

I am constantly researching how the contexts I live and work in are influencing my creations and I am observing how personal domain interacts with artistic. I gave up on trying to separate them. 
Despair is one of my main choreographic tools. 

I am deliberately escaping “finding my aesthetics”, that would be the end of the adventure, but some artistic interests and topics have stuck with me:
absurdism, surrealism, mix of fictive, abstract and real; 
concepts and aesthetics of failure and inefficiency; 
meaning-making, (mis)communication; 
intersection between visual and sonic; 
tension between individual and collective, displacement. 

Lately my ideas spin around the topic of neurodivergence. Having first-hand experience with this topic, I am researching on the ways to make it into material, without illustration or representation, and, in the same time, how to make the topic visible without putting it on my flag (I'm not a fan of flags of any kind).

I have been inside and outside of my own works and performed for my colleagues.Collaboration and co-authorship is the best way to create for me.

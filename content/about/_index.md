title = "Algorithms for dance"
+++

i am a choreographer, dance maker, performer, dance dramaturg and educator.   

i see dance making as a way of knowledge production, inseparable from life and politics.  


currently the main themes of my works are:  
.. ethics of artificial intelligence and data feminism  
.. "mental illness", neurodiversity and mental health care system  
.. migration, displacement, border politics  
.. techonologies of meaning-making and (mis)communication  
  
  

my choreographic tools are movement, text, video, absurdity, despair, irony, risk.  
i work with the crossovers of biographical, abstract and fictional.

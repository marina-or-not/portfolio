+++

i am a choreographer, dance maker, performer, dance dramaturg and educator.   
i see dance making as a way of knowledge production, inseparable from life and politics.  

currently the main themes of my works are:  
_.. ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Data Feminism_  
_.. Mad Studies: "mental illness", neurodiversity and mental health care system_  
_.. migration, displacement, border politics_  
_.. low-tech of meaning-making and (mis)communication)_  
  
   
my choreographic tools are movement, text, video, irony, despair, risk, absurdity and the crossovers of biographical, abstract and fictional.

bio  
  
Marina Orlova (1987, Moscow) is an independent choreographer, performer, dramaturg based between Amsterdam and Moscow.  
After receiving education in sociology and cultural studies, Marina has been studying and making dance since 2012. She graduated from SNDO at the Amsterdam Academy of Theatre and Dance in 2021. Over the years she presented her works in Russia, Germany and The Netherlands, performed and collaborated with choreographers, visual and sound artists. Her main  topics are mental health, tech ethics and migration. Her aesthetics is tragicomedy and absurdism.  
Since 2020 Marina has been working with the concept of responsible AI and developed a methodology of creating paradoxical and political chatbot-performers: non-European AI (“But I’m just a Text”, 2020, Rose is a Rose gallery, Amsterdam), neurodivergent AI (“too much in the head”, 2021, Frascati, Amsterdam). With “I am a Robot and I need Therapy” these projects compile a series of exceptional artistic and technical complexity. Marina takes the role of a mediator between engineering logic and theatre apparatus in order to explore the process of meaning-making at the collision of the two worlds.  
Marina’s current artistic practice also includes writing, teaching, advising and facilitating a support group for artists.

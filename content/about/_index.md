+++

As a choreographer I mainly make movement-based performances and video dance works, also using voice and text. 

In my work I combine conceptual and processual approaches. I start with an idea or desire, then dive into _not-knowing_ and when I almost drown in it, a _concept_ always comes to the surface. I believe that creation is a dialogue with the material and concepts have their own way of unfolding and directing the work more than I ever can.

I am constantly researching how the _contexts_ I live and work in are influencing my creations and I am observing how personal domain interacts with artistic. I gave up on trying to separate them. 
_Despair_ is one of my main choreographic tools. 

I am deliberately _escaping_ “finding my aesthetics”, that would be the end of the adventure, but some artistic interests and topics have stuck with me:  
_absurdism_, surrealism, mix of _fictive, abstract and real_;  
concepts and aesthetics of _failure_;   
_meaning-making_, (mis)_communication_;   
intersection between _visual and sonic_;   
tension between individual and _collective_, _displacement_, _layering_.
